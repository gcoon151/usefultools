Tools that I build to do everyday tasks better

route to app takes a hostname in hostname.domain.com and finds out the details and changes to that org/space

guid_to_something takes an app guid "cf app appname --guid" and gives you the details for whatever the "something" is. 

strip.sh takes json "foo": "bar", input and just prints out bar (without quotes and all the other stuff)
